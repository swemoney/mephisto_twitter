Twitter Status plugin for Mephisto
----------------------------------

A quick edit of Dan Webb's (http://www.danwebb.net) lastfm plugin to give you
a nice little liquid tag for your templates to display your twitter status or 
a few other timelines in your mephisto blog.

Usage
-----

To display your statuses, you'd want to do something like this...

{% twittertimeline user: 'username', type: 'user_timeline' as status %}
  <li>{{ status.text }} - {{ status.relative_created_at }}</li>
{% endtwittertimeline %}

Check out http://twitter.com/help/api for more information on all the
attributes of each status. You can also use {{ twittertimeline.index }} to 
reference what index number your at in the loop.

You can display a few other timelines as well. Try replacing user_timeline with
friends_timeline or friends. Currently, these are the only timelines supported
because the followers timeline needs some basic auth that I haven't implimented
yet. Caching should work too. You can change try and change the value in 
twitter.rb for @@expire_cache_every if you wish cache to auto flush quicker or
not so quick. In the future, I'm going to look into implimenting the the basic
auth stuff and maybe even a way to update your status via your blog. We'll see

Most of the credit for this plugin has to go to Dan Webb. Head on over to 
http://www.danwebb.net to check out his blog and his work. This plugin was pretty
much just a very quick edit of his lastfm plugin (which also works great, btw).
